# Verbal Velocity

## Typing Game Prototype

This is the prototype version of "Verbal Velocity," a simple web-based typing speed test game. This version was developed as a learning exercise with assistance, serving as a foundational "proof of concept" for future development.

### How to Play

1.  Open `verbal_velocity.html` in your web browser.
2.  Start typing the words displayed on the screen.
3.  Your WPM (Words Per Minute) and Accuracy will be calculated in real-time.
4.  The game automatically restarts after the timer runs out.

### Features

* Real-time WPM and Accuracy tracking.
* Character-by-character highlighting for correct/incorrect input.
* Display of upcoming words for continuous flow.
* Automatic game restart after timer concludes.

### Future Plans: The Recode Update

My primary goal is to re-code this entire project independently from scratch. This "Recode Update" will be a completely self-developed version, incorporating lessons learned from this prototype and my own design and implementation choices. It will aim for:
* [Add your specific goals for the recode here, e.g., improved UI, new features, cleaner code, etc.]

### Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
